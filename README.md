The VSButton module is designed to create modern and stylish buttons that resemble those used in the Visual Studio main page. These buttons are not only visually appealing but also highly customizable. With this module, you can effortlessly integrate these buttons into your Tkinter-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
